# Course Title: Data Analysis and Visualization (3 Cr.)

Course Code: **CACS455**

Year/Semester: **IV/VIII**

Class Load: **5 Hrs./ Week (Theory: 3Hrs. Practical: 2Hrs.)**

## Course Description

Data Analysis and Visualization intends to extend studentâ€™s knowledge and practice in data analysis and visualization, software, and applications. It provides the board overview of techniques of the visualization process, detailed view of visual perception, the visualized data and the actual visualization, interaction and distorting techniques.

### Course objectives

Upon completion of this course, students should be able to 1. Explain the concept of visualization in the processing and analysis of data. 2. Develop visualization methods and visualization systems using software applications. 3. Perform creative work in the field of visualization.
