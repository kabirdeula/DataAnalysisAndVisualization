# Unit 2: Creating Visual Representation

## Visualization Reference Model

It is a conceptual model that describe the different components involved in data visualization and act as a guide to design and development of visualization system to help users to understand to interpret the result and use visualization in effective way. It helps data analysts, designers and stakeholders to ensure that the visualizations are clear informative and aligned with the goals of the project. It provides set of guidelines and design principle that can be used to create visually appealing and informative visualization eccentrics like charts, graphs, line charts, scatter plot etc. Following are the common element that a visual reference model includes:

- **Data**: represents the elements that are being visualized and can be structure or unstructured or quantitative or qualitative.

- **Interaction**: it shows how user can interact with visualization or in what ways user can interact. This includes the features like zooming, panning, tooltips and filtering.

- **Color**: specify a consistent color to use in visualization which makes the output more visually appealing. This includes guidelines for primary colors, accent color, how to use color to represent different data categories or values.

- **Evaluation**: this includes the way that the effectiveness of the visualization is measured as well as the way the visualization is tailored to the needs of the users.

- **Layout**: determine the overall layout of the visualization including the placement of axes, legends and data element. This includes margins, padding and spacing to create a balanced composition.

- **Data Encoding**: define how variables should be mapped to visual properties such as position, size, shape and color. It ensures that the encoding choices align with the goals of the visualization and make it easy for viewer to interpret the data.

- **Annotations and Labels**: specify guidelines for adding annotations, titles and labels to clarify and contextualize the dat. Annotation can include trend line, labels or text.

- **Legends and Scales**: define how legends and scales should be presented when using color, size or other visual encodings. Legends helps to interpret the visualization.

- **Consistency**: this includes consistent use of colors, fonts and design element. It helps to maintain minimum deviation between actual result and result from visualization tools.

## Visual Mapping

It refers to the process of assigning visual attributes and properties to data elements in order to represent specific information and patterns effectively. That is, it is the process of representing data in visual perceptive using different visualization eccentrics like map, chart, graph etc. it is a crucial step to transform raw data into meaningful and informative visual representation and involves thoughtful decisions about encoding data using visual variables to create clear and insightful visualization. It helps viewer to interpret data quickly and accurately by understanding human perception and cognition. It includes making decision about encoding data variables, using visual channels such as position, size, color shape and texture. When choosing a visual mapping technique, following factor should be considered:

- The type of data that are to be visualized.
- The message to be communicate with viewer.
- The target viewer.
- The available tools and resources.

Some of the examples of visual mappings are bar chars that uses bars to represent different values and comparison between them, line charts to show trends or change over time, scatterplot that uses dot to show correlation between variables, pie chart that uses slices of pie to show relative proportion of different values, map that uses geographic features to show relation between different data points. The choice of mapping depends on the data type, the message to be conveyed and the target audience. Following are the key aspect of visual mapping in data visualization:

- **Visual Variables**: are the attributes that can be used to encode data like position (x axis and y axis to create scatterplots, bar charts etc.), size (represents data value by varying the size of graphical elements like points, bar etc.), color (to distinguish categories, numerical values or emphasize specific data points), shape (circle, square, triangles etc. to encode categories or data attributes), texture (to differentiate data elements when color is not suitable or to add addivional encoding), opacity/transparency (to show overlapping data points or emphasize specific data regions).

- **Mapping Data Types**: data types like nominal, ordinal, interval ratio require different visual mappings. Nominal data may be mapped using distinct colors or shapes while ordinal data might use gradients of color or size to indicate order.

- **Data Attributes**: includes specific attributes like quantitative, categorical, temporal or spatial which may require different mapping strategy.

- **Scale and Range**: determine the range of values for each visual variables in which different color can be mapped using continuous gradient or discrete color palette.

- **Normalization**: while comparing multiple data attributes or datasets it is necessary to normalize or standardize the data to ensure fair and meaningful visual comparisons

- **Interactivity**: this includes effects like zooming, filtering or highlighting data points through user interaction

- **Accessibility**: ensures that the chosen visual mappings are accessible to all users and should provide alternative text for visual elements and consider using proper color palettes.

## Visual Analytics

### Importance of Visual Alanlytics

- Enhanced data understanding
- Effective communication
- Decision Making
- Real time monitoring
- Pattern recognition

## Design of Visualization Applications

- Define objectives and user goals.
- Understand audience
- Select proper visualisation
- Plan data preperations
- Visual Consistency
- Testing and Iterations
- Continuous maintainance

- Use a consistent visual style throughout the application which will help to understand the data and to make sense of visualisation.
- User clear and cocise labels for the data
- User a limited number of visual elements and visulisation
